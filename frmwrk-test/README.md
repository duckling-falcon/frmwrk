Testing frmwrk
==============

This test uses an embedded tomcat8x at port 8080. Please ensure the
port is available.

Run test by 'mvn verify'.

The java files show how to write a client that calls
ServiceCient.sendService() essentially. And the xml files show how to
configure. They are helpful for using the framework.
